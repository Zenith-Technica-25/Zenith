# Zenith

Zenith: A space-themed wellness task tracker.
Only in the darkest night can you face the sky and see the stars.

As college students, we often get overloaded with assignments, exams, and clubs - often at the expense of our mental wellbeing. We wanted to create a task-tracker that reminded us to take time for ourselves in a fun manner that incorporated our shared passion - space!

How to use:

- Open Zenith on any browser, for best viewing open on a computer or laptop.
- Click on the Zenith to return to Home. On the Home screen, add tasks, click on tasks to complete them and add their points to your counter.
  - As your points accumulate, you will see your rocket get built.
  - At 400 points, click Launch to send your rocket to space and add a module to your Space Station.
- Click on the Space Station in the navigation bar to view your progress in building the Space Station. As you gain more modules, your station will expand downwards.
  - Tip: if you find a shooting star, click on it to receive a self-care tip!
